### Basics of sentiment analysis 

Sentiment analysis aims to determine the affective state â€” something more persistent than an emotion and less persistent than a mood â€” of a particular text. There are two broad ways of approaching the task:  

ðŸ‘‰ Dictionaries: using lists of words grouped by categories. We count how many words from a category are in a text to determine its sentiment. Some well-validated dictionaries include Harvard General Inquirer 4, LIWC, and VADER.

Pros: simple, fast, transparent, lower risk of overfitting. 
Cons: sensitive to dictionary choice and scoring systems, donâ€™t get sarcasm, high risk of underfitting.
 
ðŸ‘‰ Classifiers: using machine learning techniques to determine sentiment. Usually, you would either need to have labeled data (ie some of your text items would need to be labeled by a human as belonging to a category), or use a model pre-trained by someone else. Some suitable models include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, k-nearest neighbors, and neural nets.

Pros: pick up on nuances and get better results, donâ€™t need to compile a dictionary.
Cons: may need labeled data, less transparent, can be time-consuming to train, higher risk of overfitting.

In psychology, we prefer dictionaries over classifiers because that way itâ€™s easier to relate the sentiment to psychological phenomena weâ€™re studying as opposed to the quirks of the model. Additionally, classifiers can be way more costly since specialized categories require new human-labeled samples. Itâ€™s usually easier to creat a new dictionary with the necessary category (like moral emotional words, words expressing temptation, etc).
